# SMURPHS_OHC
Notebooks to reproduce figures from "Ocean Heat Content responses to changing Anthropogenic Aerosol Forcing Strength: regional and multi-decadal variability" Boland et al 2022 (doi coming).

Each notebook loads data from ../data_out/ and plots to ../figs/ automatically, although this can be altered. To work, data_out should contain the files from [figshare details]. 

Feel free to use or reproduce the code and figures but please attribute as outlined in the license.
