figure_notebooks: Jupyter notebooks to reproduce figures (and one table) from "Ocean Heat Content responses to changing Anthropogenic Aerosol Forcing Strength: regional and multi-decadal variability" Boland et al 2022 (doi coming).

Each notebook loads data from ../data_in/. To work, data_in should contain the files from [figshare details]. Alternatively this data can be re-generated using the python files in the code directory - see below.

code: Python code to create the data for the figures. Automatically writes to ../data_in/. Requires access to raw model output data which can be accessed [reference] and a machine to run the analyis. 

Feel free to use or reproduce the code and figures but please attribute as outlined in the license.
